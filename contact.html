          Joined BloomTech's backend development program, where I learned
          Java OOP, algorithms, APIs, threading, and more. I gained hands-on
          experience with real-world projects, including debugging, unit
          testing, and Agile methodologies.

          Driven by curiosity, I expanded my skills to include front-end
          technologies like JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and React.js. My
          experience at BloomTech has equipped me with the knowledge and
          adaptability needed to succeed as a software developer.
